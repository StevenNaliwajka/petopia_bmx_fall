# The city around the park

On maps that have one (today: `gm_skatepark`), the addon builds a city around
the park: buildings stand on every wall instead of bare brick, a second row and
a skyline rise behind them, and three elevated subway lines cross overhead,
with trains running over them on a timetable.

Nothing in the map is edited. The city is drawn by the client
(`lua/petopia_bmx_fall/cl_city.lua`) from a layout that `lua/petopia_bmx_fall/sh_city.lua` builds out
of a per-map definition (`lua/petopia_bmx_fall/sh_city_maps.lua`). The parts riders can
touch (the viaducts and their piers) get colliders, `bmx_city_solid`
entities spawned by `lua/petopia_bmx_fall/sv_city.lua`. It uses only HL2/GMod content, so
there is nothing extra to download.

## How it fits around a sealed map

`gm_skatepark` is one box: brick walls to z 528, sky brushes above, ceiling
z 1720. The sky brushes are not drawn as geometry, so anything drawn beyond
them shows through. The frontage's facades stand 4 units inside the walls and
cover the brick from the floor up. The buildings' bodies and everything behind
them are out in the void, where nobody can reach, so they need no collision.
The engine never draws entities out there (no visleaf), which is why the city
is a render hook and not entities.

## Settings

| Convar | Realm | Default | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bmx_city` | server, replicated | 1 | build the city on maps that have one |
| `bmx_city_draw` | client | 1 | draw it |
| `bmx_city_trains` | client | 1 | run the trains and their sound |
| `bmx_city_signs` | client | 1 | draw the signs |
| `bmx_city_plants` | client | 1 | draw the trees and street lamps |
| `bmx_city_mood` | client | 1 | the late-autumn sky, haze, colour grade and lamplight |
| `bmx_city_leaves` | client | 1 | leaves falling from the trees |

Commands: `bmx_city_info` (what this map's city has), `bmx_city_rebuild`
(admin; respawn the colliders after changing `bmx_city`), and
`bmx_city_rebuild_client`.

## Late autumn: greenery, floor, lamps and the hour

The park is dressed for a late fall afternoon (the map's `greenery`, `floor`
and `mood` tables).

- **Planting beds** stand against the walls in lanes measured clear of every
  ramp. Each has a concrete kerb, grass, a hedge, trees, ivy climbing the wall
  behind and street lamps. The bed and the tree trunks and lamp poles are
  solid (`bmx_city_solid`), so a bike stops at the kerb.
- **Trees** are HL2 models (`hl2_misc`/`garrysmod` VPKs only, so nobody needs
  HL2 mounted) wearing a crown of leaf cards in red, orange, gold and rust, the
  same leaves the hedges are made of. They sway in a west wind with gusts.
- **The frontage** has roof gardens (planters, trees over the cornice, ivy
  hanging down), planted terraces in front of setback towers, and balconies
  with planters on the upper floors.
- **The floor** is laid over the map's single concrete slab, a hair above it:
  slab concrete to ride on, brick paving along the walls, cobbles round the
  piers, a kerb line, and drifts of fallen leaves. The afternoon light and a
  warm pool under every lamp are baked into its vertices.
- **The mood** (`cl_city_mood.lua`) swaps the noon sky for HL2's golden
  `sky_day01_08` (turned so the glow sits in the west, where the map's sun
  is), adds a thin warm haze and a slight warm grade, glows at the lamp
  heads, dynamic lights from the nearest lamps (models only), and the odd leaf
  falling and settling.
- **Signs are lit, not glowing**: each board is shaded to the light where it
  stands (`signLight`, brighter near a lamp), and a billboard's own lamps
  throw warm pools down its face.

Nothing here is an entity a player can touch: plants are drawn by the client
from the render hook (never faded or culled by distance, always at full
LOD), and the solid parts are `bmx_city_solid`, which the physgun, gravity
gun, toolgun and context menu all refuse.

## The map: petopia_bmx_fall

The city now belongs to the **petopia_bmx_fall** map (this repository), whose
BSP is our own compile (`mapsrc/build_vmf.py`, `tools/build-map.sh`): the same
play box, walls, sky ceiling and spawns as gm_skatepark, which the city was
measured against, with our own brush ramps at the same footprints. The city
table is still keyed by both names (`Maps.petopia_bmx_fall = Maps.gm_skatepark`),
so gm_skatepark keeps its city too.

`sv_city.lua` sends the map icon (`maps/thumb/petopia_bmx_fall.png`) to
everyone who joins (`resource.AddFile`). Clients download the map from the
server.

(Until 2026-10-07 the test server ran a renamed copy of gm_skatepark's BSP
under this name. That copy was somebody else's map and is gone; this BSP is
ours and can be published.)

## Changing the city

Everything is in the map's table in `sh_city_maps.lua`:

- `seed`: a different seed gives a different city with the same rules.
  The generator is private and seeded, so every realm builds the same one.
- `frontage`, `backRow`: lot widths, depths, floor counts, styles, setback
  towers. One floor is 128 units, one HL2 `building_template` panel.
- `skyline`: tower count, distance band, heights.
- `viaducts`: each line's axis, position, deck height, train period, offset,
  cars and speed, its number and colour (`label`, `color`), and `ends`: the
  terminus past each end (`to` is where trains going from -> to are headed,
  `from` the way back). A train's nose and tail boards and the station sign at
  each portal (a `transit` sign with `metro = "<line name>"`) all read from
  `ends`, so one direction always goes to one place (`tests/test_trains.lua`).
  `piers` stand under the crossings.
- `signs`: text panels on the facades.

Styles (which panels go on the street floor, the floors above and the
cornice) and materials are at the top of `sh_city.lua`.

To look at a change without starting the game:

    lua5.1 tools/city/export.lua gm_skatepark > layout.json
    python3 tools/city/preview.py layout.json texdump view.png  100 -1500 130 35 -18

`texdump/` comes from `tools/city/texdump.py`, run on a GMod server.

`tests/test_city.lua` holds the rules a layout must keep, checked against
every ramp's measured footprint: solids clear of every ramp and spawn by 40
units, viaducts at least 400 over the tallest coping, lines that cross without
touching and stay under the sky ceiling, every portal covered by a tall enough
building, trains that come out of one portal and go into the other. Change the
map's table and run `tools/run-tests.sh city`.

## Another map

Measure the map's play box, floor height and sun (the brush and entity lumps
of the BSP), add a table under its name, and put any piers in clear lanes. If
the map is not a sealed box, the frontage covers whatever is behind its walls.
