    lua/petopia_bmx_fall/sh_city_maps.lua

    The city, per map. One table per map name; sh_city.lua builds it. To give
    another map a city, measure its play box and add an entry -- nothing else
    changes.

    THE NUMBERS FOR gm_skatepark ARE MEASURED FROM ITS BSP, not eyeballed
    (2026-10-07, from the brush and entity lumps):

        play box     x -256..3584, y -1792..768, floor z 64
        brick wall   to z 528 on all four sides, 256 thick
        sky brushes  above the wall, ceiling at z 1720
        sun          light_environment pitch -28, yaw 0: light travels +x, so
                     the sun sits low in the WEST and the east row's fronts
                     catch it

    Every ramp in the map was measured too (each one's WorldSpaceAABB on the
    running server, in tests/test_city.lua; NOT the models' vertices, which
    studiomdl stores turned 90 degrees from entity space -- the first layout
    was checked against those and put a pier on the halfpipe): the piers stand in the lanes between
    them, the viaducts pass 500+ units above the tallest coping, and nothing
    the city adds touches the floor anywhere else.
